# UCC Retrofit Demo app

The app made in the UCC Android lab to demo [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)

## Setup

 1. Open the `TeamworkApiService` class located at:
`./app/src/main/java/com/aidangrabe/ucc/api/TeamworkApiService.java`
 2. Change the `API_KEY` constant to the value sent out by email.

## Trouble shooting

If you can't build the app, make sure your SDK-tools, build-tools and platform tools are up to date.
You can update these via the SDK-manager.

Make sure you have the latest `Android Support Library`, `Android Support Repository` and `Google Repository`

If you keep getting the "Error downloading tasks" toast message, make sure that your `API_KEY` is correct
